## Problem Statement
Looking for a job comes with its fair share of problems, but when you’re a graduate student,
balancing studies and finding time to look for employment is strenuous with students coming
into the career development looking visibly upset being a common sight. The problem is exacerbated by other factors: information overload ( i.e. too many resources and content), not feeling confident enough with portfolios, resumes and other application materials and so on. Ninety-eight percent of all UMSI students find jobs or internship in their field of choice , so my goal for this project is to understand what makes the current intern finding process so stressful,
and try to improve the experience of finding employment opportunities and hence, make it less
taxing.
